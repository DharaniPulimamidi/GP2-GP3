First created a lamda function as ebs_volume_check . 
Then create a Test event so that lamda function can run !!!
##Deploy before Testing!!!
Then go to cloud watch -
Configure rule 
For checking if the lamda function is exectued you can check in log groups in cloud watch (check latest)
Now you can write the code in the function .
After the code is written you have to delete the old volume and create a new volume every time you test the code .
If the code is correct then the gp2 is converted to gp3 .
